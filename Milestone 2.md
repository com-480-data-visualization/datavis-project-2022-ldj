## Project Goal
- The goal of this project is to aggregate certain COVID-19 information in the US into easily understandable visualizations that demonstrate trends and insights. Through exploring our visualizations, the users will directly see the progress of the pandemic in each state and how they compare to each other. Moreover, we also aim to create some visualizations that show the effectiveness of COVID protection measures including vaccination. To achieve this goal, we will break it down into independent pieces to be implemented as follows. 

## Core Visualization
### 1.Interactive Map

## Extra Visualizations

## Independent pieces to implement
- Map visualization overview
- Line plots of deaths and vaccination 
- Brushes to filter by date
- Navigational search (drop-down menu) to select a state
- Plots for vaccination effectiveness
- Bar plots for state ranking 

## Tools
- ***D3.js***, ***Leaflet***, ***GeoJson*** for Interactive map 
- ***D3-brush***, ***D3-zoom*** for the time slider
- ***Chart.js*** for bar plot

## Lectures
First, the whole project relies on lectures on HTML,CSS, Javascript and D3.js to structure the website, as well as lectures on designing visualization and story-telling for the design draft.
More importantly, lectures on Maps and interaction would be most significant for our core mapping visualizations. We also need lectures on perception colors, marks and channels for specific details.

## Add-on
A possible add-on would be a 3d globe projection to plane when loading our core map.

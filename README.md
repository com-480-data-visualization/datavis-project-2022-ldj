## Milestone 1 (Friday 8th April 5pm)

### Dataset

We chose to visualize two datasets together concerning Coronavirus.

- [Coronavirus (Covid-19) Data in the United States](https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data): the cumulative daily number of cases and deaths reported in each county and state across the United States from January 2020 to April 2022
- [USA COVID-19 Vaccinations](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/usa-covid19-vaccinations): a recent state-by-state data, covering from December 2020 to April 2022, on COVID-19 vaccinations in the United States.

Since we are combining the two datasets, we need to have the preprocessing step to visualize them better. First, we must eliminate the [Coronavirus (Covid-19) Data](https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data) from January 2020 to December 2020 since the [USA COVID-19 Vaccinations](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/usa-covid19-vaccinations) data began in December 2020. Second, both of the founders are updating the datasets every day. We need to determine an end date for our visualization.
The founders designed the data to be quickly usable, so no data-cleaning is needed.



### Problematic 

Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Most people who fall sick with COVID-19 will experience mild to moderate symptoms and recover without special treatment. However, some will become seriously ill and require medical attention.

COVID-19 has been around for several years now, and it is not going away any time soon with all the new variants that are constantly hitting the news. Most people are probably tired of hearing all the bad news about this infectious disease, and many countries are already shifting back to normal operations. While people are trying to go back to normal lives, it is also essential to look back at the paths we have taken and reexamine data about this virus. We could learn so many valuable things from this pandemic, and our project here aims to show some insights in the form of data visualization.

Our goal is to showcase trends and insights about the COVID-19 pandemic in the US using attractive data visualization techniques. This includes, but is not limited to:
- showing trends of covid cases with respect to time, and using data to illustrate what might have caused that trend
- finding correlations in vaccination rate, covid cases, and death
- allowing users to freely explore data in different geographical locations, times, types of variants, and protection methods to form their own opinions based on visuals and statistics
- gaining insights on how we could do better in future pandemics

Our targeted audience is people who want to learn more about this pandemic through data and those who care about the lives lost due to ineffective safety measures. We will put our best effort into making the visualizations fun and engaging. However, the data behind them entails unprecedented losses for humanity, and we must learn from it to do better in the future.

- Why is your approach original?

  - Our approach aims to combine multiple datasets and extract correlations and insights out of them. Plus, we will build out an interactive platform that allows the users to discover their own findings and opinions from the visualization. There are so many possibilities from our approach and thus it is original. 
- What source of inspiration do you take? Visualizations that you found on other websites or magazines (might be unrelated to your data).
